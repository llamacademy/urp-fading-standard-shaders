# URP Fading Standard Shaders

Learn how you can easily fade out objects that are using the standard URP shaders that obstruct view to the player using C# code!
Using the Built-In Render Pipeline? It's a very similar process. Check out [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/llamacademy/fade-objects-standard-shader) with accompanying [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIC4wbUgt5M) for the same effect, but for the Built-In Render Pipeline.

In [THIS tutorial](https://youtu.be/vmLIy62Gsnk) you'll see how to determine which material properties to adjust for the standard URP shaders:
* `Unversal Render Pipeline/Lit`
* `Unversal Render Pipeline/Complex Lit`
* `Unversal Render Pipeline/Simple Lit`
* `Unversal Render Pipeline/Unlit`
* `Unversal Render Pipeline/Baked Lit`
as well as learn the process to determine which properties to modify for any other shader when documentation is lacking!

In my tests this performs on average, 0.04ms per frame with the code here, which is, in my opinion, for most cases "good enough" performance to use when you do not know how to make a shader to do this, or just want to keep using the standard URP shaders.
